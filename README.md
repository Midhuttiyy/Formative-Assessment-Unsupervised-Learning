# Formative-Assessment-Unsupervised-Learning






##Explanation :

1. Loading and Preprocessing

- Loaded Iris dataset from sklearn.
- Dropped species column since this is a clustering problem.
- Scaled features using StandardScaler.

2. Clustering Algorithm Implementation

A) KMeans Clustering

- Description: KMeans clustering partitions data into K clusters based on mean distance.
- Suitability: KMeans suitable for Iris dataset due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling continuous features.
- Visualization: Scatter plot shows clusters.

B) Hierarchical Clustering

- Description: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure by merging or splitting clusters.
- Suitability: Hierarchical clustering suitable for Iris dataset to identify nested cluster structures.
- Visualization: Scatter plot shows clusters.
